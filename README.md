# BYUI Data Science SQL Server Usage Guide

## Introduction
The purpose of the BYUI Data Science SQL Server is to twofold:
1. Provide a convenient mechanism for Data Science students to store and retrieve data for large projects.
2. Provide an authentic experience that prepares Data Science students to interface with a SQL Server in the workplace.

To fulfill this ongoing purpose, this guide provides instruction for maintenance and use of the BYUI Data Science SQL Server. Two distinct roles, each with their own set of server permissions have been created to preserve the rigorous structure of the server. These roles are titled “Editor” and “Student”. Editors are responsible for creating a new database on the server for each project, uploading initial data to that database, and maintaining the database throughout the lifetime of its associated project. Students are responsible for using the server to read data into their sessions of RStudio. The remainder of this guide provides specific instruction for each of these two roles.
